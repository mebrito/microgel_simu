Program for simulating a single ionic microgel in a cell to explore swelling properties of microgels with networks of different polymer blocks:
- The microgel consists of a finite diamond polymer network of tetrafunctional nodes
- Polymer are simulated via WCA potential with FENE bonds
- Electrostatic is incorporated explicitly by charged polymer beads and free co- and counterions
